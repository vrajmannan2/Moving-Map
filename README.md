<p>
  This is my Moving-Map project, <br>
  The objective of the map is to label a bus route from M.I.T to Harvard. <br>
  The map shows the whole route from M.I.T to Harvard.<br>
  You are able to run the program by hitting the button on the top right.<br>
  I am looking to improve this program in the future by adding different routes and showing how traffic is at different times during the day.<br>
